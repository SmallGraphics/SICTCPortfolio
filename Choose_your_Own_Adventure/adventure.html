                after brushing it off, it appears to be a trapdoor of sorts. It probably won't open.</p>

                After grabbing it, you see a split in the cave, 2 tunnels, as you get closer, you hear human-like voices from the left,<br><br>
                but nothing from the right. Your only option is to go deeper, so which tunnel will you take?</p>

            <p class="ha">After traversing down the left tunnel, listening to the human-like chatter, you see a funky door.<br><br>
                Upon opening it, time seems to slow down, and a gruff knome-like creature grabs you by your knees and drags you to an electric chair of sorts.<br><br>
                "We are the spriggs," the rest of them in the room say. He sits you in the electric chair.<br><br>
                "We demand 1 ApeCoin if you wanna leave. Pay up or die a worse death."</p>

                There's only around 50 seconds until impact, but miraculously, on your second try,<br><br>
                you manage to open the trapdoor. All you see is a ladder that leads to seamingly nowhere.</p>

                Near the left wall, you see a pile of general purpose bombs.<br><br>
                You also see an open vent on the right wall, around the same size as the diameter of the bombs.<br><br>
                As your only option is to go deeper, you must think quick.</p>

                After you tap on the vent to get their attention, they, without hesitation, open the vent and execute you<br><br>
                with the most barbaric of weapons.</p>

                you briefly hear high-pitched muffled screaming, just before a loud bang. There are around 25 seconds until the meteor's impact.</p>

                and you see what seems to be the charred remainings of a weird knome-like civilization. On the ground in front of you,<br><br>
                there is a strange glowing orb. You reach out to grab it, but when you touch it, you are suddenly blown back on the floor,<br><br>
                and time seems to speed back up to normal. You soon find out that this magically disintegrated the meteor, with seconds to spare.<br><br>
                Could the knomes have planned this all along?</p>

                Because of this deep, deep fall, you've gotten yourself so deep underground that the meteor's destruction<br<br>
